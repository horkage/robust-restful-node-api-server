==============================

A somewhat robust RESTful nodejs api server

This server was the result of a side project, and I have tried to keep it "neutral" for github.  Most notably, it uses bunyan, cluster and domains.  This instance of node was meant to be started by the shell script located in the root.  There are two dummy api endpoints - one is a straight bang and the other is an HTTP post proxy.

This server is a good reference point for myself on how certain modules are tied together along with an overall code structure.
